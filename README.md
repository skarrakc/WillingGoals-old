# WillingGoals

WillingGoals is a small implementation of the MCII approach. The app allows users to:

-Write down thier list of goals (e.g: losing weight)
-Write down and visualize Positive aspects of thier goals (e.g: looking good,living longer,being able to stay active,etc)
-Obstacles that they can face and how they can deal with them (e.g: being tempted by snacks => Replace them by apples).

Then the user can choose a list of goals he want to deal with during the next days and put them in his MCII list.
Every morning, the app will send a notification with a reminder of goals selected and their positive aspects to motivate him.

For the moment, notifications are not working as expected. I am currently working on this issue.
